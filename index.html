          <p>
            Mountain biking doesn't mean you need to be biking in a mountain.
            Any kind of biking in the wilderness can be considered mountain
            biking. There are different types of mountain bikes, each suited to
            a certain discipline within the sport. The most commonly known one
            is a full suspension bike. This has suspension on both the front and
            rear wheel allowing you to maintain traction in all kinds of trail
            conditions.

            These bikes are mainly used for paved surfaces. These bikes are
            designed to put the rider in an aerodynamic riding position. They
            also have low rolling resistance tires and lower gear ratios that
            allow the rider to go fast... like 40+ mph :O!!! As with mountain
            bikes, these bikes also have different types. Unlike mountain bikes
            that have a distinct style/capability for a trail, road bikes follow
            similar designs as they are meant to be used in the same riding
            conditions. There is the regular "raod bike" and a gravel bike.

            Hybrid bikes are a combination of mountain bikes and road bikes.
            They combine the speed and functionality of a road bike and the
            style and comfort of a mountain bike. This way the user is
            comfortable riding the bike for communiting while also having the
            ability to take care of different gear ratios to tackle different
            obastacles.

          <p>
            Speciality bikes are bikes that are unique for a certain task. Some
            common types of speciality bikes are beach crusiers, unicycles, and
            fixies. Beach crusiers have 1 gear ratio that is appropiate for
            riding on the beach. They have wider tires to allow you to ride on
            the sand. Unicycles are just for those CRAZY PEOPLE. You need an
            immense amount of control over your balance and skill to help you
            balance. Fixies are also known as track bikes. They are used mainly
            on indoor circuits as the pedas are fixed to the rear tire. This
            means that the pedals turn with the rear tire. It won't stop when
            you stop pedaling!

            As mentioned before, mountain bikes are mainly used for biking in
            the wilderness. They can double down and be used on the road but
            this is not reccommended as the tires are soft and can do unexpected
            things on the road that may lead to an accident. They also wear much
            faster on the pavement than on the trails. Mountain biking can also
            be a few hours long or can become a journey known as "bike packing."
            Both activies are a lot of fun for people of all ages.

          <p>
            As mentioned before, road bikes are very similar to each other. They
            all have similar styles to make the rider as aerodynamic as possible
            as well as have low gear ratios to allow the bike to go super fast.
            The main things that change within this world is tires and the
            material used to create the bike. Although these 2 items may seem
            insignificant, they can change the characteristics of the bike to
            make it feel as though it were a different bike! This activity can
            be done alone although it is usually done as a group.

            to ride as they require a lot of balance.

            In nearly every form of transportation created, mankind has created
            some form of a race associated with it. Bikes are no exception.
            There are plenty of races in both mountain biking and road biking.
            One of the most notable races in the world for cycling is the Tour
            de France. They use road bikes in that race. It is fun to watch at
            first but may get old after a while if you are not into the sport.
            The olympics have a bunch of sports in the summer regarding the
            different kinds of racing, including track racing! Track racing is
            just indoor racing on a track that looks similar a track but is
            curved and made of wood. Fixies are used to race on them.

            E-bikes are bicycles but have a motor as a part of the drivetrain.
            There are pedal assist e-bikes which assist the user when they are
            pedaling. There are also full on drive bicycles where the motor will
            power the bike itself like an electric motorcycle. These bikes
            provide additional assistance to the rider which make them illegal
            to use in any kind of race. They also go too fast which is why they
            are banned on certain bike paths or mountain trails. They are
            dangerous because of their speed but if used correctly, they can
            extend the range a rider can go which opens a load of possibilities
            and adventures.

            Most road bikes are not even capable of doing a basic fire trail (a
            smooth path in the mountain to allow fire-fighting equipment to
            fight fires). There is the "gravel bike" which puts wider towers and
            a less aggressive riding position. It usually has no suspension but
            can be found with suspension on the fork in rare cases. This bike is
            ONLY meant for light gravel areas and should not be ridden as a
            mountain bike!

            These bikes are a cross between road bikes and mountain bikes. They
            often have suspension on the fork if they are more "mountain"
            oriented or no suspension if it is more "commuter" oriented. These
            bikes combine both of these worlds to make a bike that can't really
            do mountain trails nor go fast on the road. But they are very
            comfortable and are a great bike for those that don't want to invest
            thousands into a bike.

            Mountain bikes are like tanks. A full suspension mountain bike can
            go anywhere you can imagine. There are some crazy people that even
            go down mountain sides that can be considered as cliffs to some. But
            on the road, these bikes don't really feel stable as the nobby tires
            have a tendency to wiggle on the hard pavement. And the suspension
            takes some of your energy when you are going up hill.
